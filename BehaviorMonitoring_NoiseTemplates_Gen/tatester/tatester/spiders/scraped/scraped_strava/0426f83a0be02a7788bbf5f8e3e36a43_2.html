<h3>Terms of Service</h3>
<p>The Strava websites, related mobile applications and services (collectively, the “Services”) are made available to you by Strava, Inc. with its address at 208 Utah Street, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA, subject to these Terms of Service (the “Terms”) and in accordance with the Strava <a href='https://strava.com/legal/privacy'>Privacy Policy</a> (the “Privacy Policy”). More information about the Services may be found at <a href='https://strava.com'>https://strava.com</a>. You agree to comply with these Terms and any supplemental terms which Strava makes available to you on the Services which shall form part of the Terms. BY ACCESSING, USING OR UPLOADING OR DOWNLOADING ANY INFORMATION OR MATERIALS TO OR FROM THE SERVICES, OR BY INDICATING YOUR ASSENT TO THESE TERMS BY CREATING AN ACCOUNT, CLICKING “SIGN UP” OR ANY SIMILAR MECHANISM, YOU ARE AGREEING TO THE THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE THESE TERMS, DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES. This agreement was written in English. To the extent a translated version of the Terms conflict with the English version, the English version controls.</p>
<p>If you access or use the Services on behalf of a company or other entity, you represent that you have authority to bind such entity and its affiliates to these Terms and that it is fully binding on them. In such case, the term “you” will refer to such entity and its affiliates. If you do not have authority, you may not access or use the Services. These Terms contain disclaimers of warranties and limitations on liability that may be applicable to you.</p>
<p>The Strava Services cannot be provided and the agreement described in these Terms of Service cannot be performed without Strava processing data about you, and other Strava members, including your location data. Processing of the data you share with Strava, including location data, is essential to the Services which we provide and a necessary part of our performance of the agreement we have with you.</p>
<p>
<strong>Notice Regarding Dispute Resolution: These Terms contain provisions that govern how disputes between you and Strava are resolved, including an agreement to arbitrate, which will, unless you reside in the European Union, with limited exception, require you to submit claims you have against us to binding and final arbitration and limit you to claims against Strava on an individual basis, unless you opt-out in accordance with the instructions below.</strong>

<section id='registration-and-accounts'>
<h3>Registration and Accounts</h3>
<p>The Services are intended solely for persons who are 13 years old or such higher age required in your country to use the Services. If you are under the legal age to form a binding contract in your jurisdiction, you represent that your parent or legal guardian has reviewed and agreed to these Terms on your behalf.</p>
<p>To use the Services, you must register. You agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself (“Member Data”) and (b) maintain and promptly update the Member Data. You agree that Strava may use your Member Data to provide Services  that you access or use and as otherwise set forth in these Terms.

In consideration of your use of the Services, you represent that you are not a person barred from receiving services under the laws of any applicable jurisdiction.</p>

We endeavor to use reasonable security measures to protect against unauthorized access to your account. We cannot, however, guarantee absolute security of your account, your Content (as defined below) or the personal information you provide, and we cannot promise that our security measures will prevent third-party “hackers” from illegally accessing the Services or its contents. You agree to immediately notify Strava of any unauthorized use of your account or password, or any other breach of security, and confirm that you understand all risks of unauthorized access to Member Data and any other information or content you provide to Strava.</p>
<p>You may register for or log-in to your account via a third-party network, such as Facebook or Google. If you do so, you hereby authorize Strava to pre-populate the registration and other relevant information fields of your account and/or to use such third-party credentials to log you into your account. If you connect your account to a third-party network, you agree to comply with the terms and conditions and policies applicable to such third party.</p>
<p>By virtue of certain of the Services connecting to the Google Maps API, you hereby agree to be bound by the <a href='https://maps.google.com/help/terms_maps.html'>Google Maps/Google Earth Additional Terms of Service</a> (including the <a href='https://www.google.com/intl/ALL/policies/privacy/index.html'>Google Privacy Policy</a>) in connection with your use of such Services.</p>

If you upgrade your membership or add new categories of service to your account, such changes may result in a new billing date. You agree to pay the membership fees, and other charges you incur in connection with your Strava account, whether on a one-time or subscription basis. Strava reserves the right to increase membership fees, any associated taxes, or to institute new fees at any time upon reasonable advance notice.</p>

<h4>Auto-Renewal</h4>
<p>Summit membership fees will be billed automatically at the start of the monthly or annual period, as applicable. These fees will auto-renew until your Summit membership is downgraded or terminated. Your membership fee will be the same as your initial charges unless you are otherwise notified in advance. You may cancel your Summit membership at any time, as described below.</p>

<section id='claims-of-infringement'>
<h3>Claims of Infringement</h3>
<p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. Strava also reviews claims of trademark infringement. If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by Strava infringe your copyright or trademark rights, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following information: (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work or trademark claimed to have been infringed (or, if multiple copyrighted works or trademarks located on the Services are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works); (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Strava to locate the material on the Services; (d) the name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address (if available) of the complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good-faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright or trademark owner, its agent, or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. Please be advised that Strava will not respond to complaints that do not meet these requirements. If Strava determines that the materials alleged to infringe your copyright or trademark rights do not require removal, Strava will remove those materials only pursuant to a court order declaring the content or use of the materials unlawful.</p>
<p>If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send us a counter-notice. Counter-notices must include the following information: (a) your name, address, and telephone number; (b) the source of the content that was removed; (c) a statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good-faith belief that the content was removed in error; (d) a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located; or, if your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which Strava may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided the original complaint; and (e) a physical or electronic signature (for example, typing your full name).</p>
<p>Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Services must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA (see <a href='https://copyright.gov/title17/92appb.html'>https://copyright.gov/title17/92appb.html</a>) and should be sent to the agent identified below. We suggest that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice. Also, be aware that there may be penalties for false claims under the DMCA.</p>

<h3>Dispute Resolution</h3>
<section id='arbitration'>
<h4>Arbitration</h4>
<p>The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through good-faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. Except for disputes relating to the Strava’s intellectual property (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents) or if you opt out of this agreement to arbitrate, all claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement and your use of the Services shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by JAMS in accordance with its provisions and procedures for consumer-related disputes, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. The arbitrator, and not any court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court; provided, however, that the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies, or awards that conflict with this Agreement. The arbitrator’s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, Strava will pay the additional cost. You and Strava hereby expressly waive trial by jury. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person’s account, if Strava is a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. This provision does not apply to users who live in the European Union.</p>
<p>The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and that the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.</p>
</section>
<section id='class-action-waiver'>
<h4>Class-Action Waiver</h4>
<p>The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only, and not as a class action or other representative action. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class-action waiver set forth in this section is void or unenforceable for any reason, or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</p>

<h3>Choice of Law and Forum</h3>
<p>Any action related to the Terms, Content, the Services, and your relationship with the Strava shall be governed by, and construed and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws principles AND WILL SPECIFICALLY NOT BE GOVERNED BY THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS, IF OTHERWISE APPLICABLE. Subject to the Section entitled “Dispute Resolution”, the parties irrevocably consent to bring any action to enforce this Agreement in the federal or state courts embracing San Francisco, California and you consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal or state courts embracing San Francisco, California. If any party hereto brings any suit or action against another for relief, declaratory or otherwise, arising out of these Terms, the prevailing party will have and recover against the other party, in addition to all court costs and disbursements, such sum as the court may adjudge to be reasonable attorneys’ fees. Except to the extent prohibited by applicable law, the parties agree that any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Services or the Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. This paragraph does not apply to users who reside in the European Union.</p>
<p>If you are a user based in the European Union, then Irish law shall apply to these Terms and the Irish courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear disputes arising in relation to the Terms.  Despite this, your local laws in your European Union Member State may allow you to take legal action against Strava in your Member State and to invoke certain local laws against Strava.</p>

<h3>General</h3>
<p>You agree that no joint venture, partnership, joint controllership, employment or agency relationship exists between you and Strava as a result of the Terms or your use of the Services. The Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Strava with respect to your use of the Services. The failure of Strava to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms remain in full force and effect. You may not assign, delegate or otherwise transfer your account or your obligations under these Terms without the prior written consent of Strava. Strava has the right, in its sole discretion, to transfer or assign all or any part of its rights under these Terms and will have the right to delegate or use third party contractors to fulfill its duties and obligations under these Terms and in connection with the Services.
