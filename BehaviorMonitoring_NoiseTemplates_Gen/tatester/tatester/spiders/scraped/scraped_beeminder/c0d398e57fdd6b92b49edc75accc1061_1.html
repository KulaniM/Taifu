    <h1>What is Beeminder?</h1>
    <p>
    It's reminders with a sting! Or, goal-tracking with teeth.
    Mind anything you can graph
    &mdash; weight, pushups, to-do tasks completed &mdash;
    by replying with data when Beeminder prompts you.
    Or connect with a service (like Fitbit or RescueTime) to report automatically.
    We plot your progress on a Yellow Brick Road to your goal.
    Keep all your datapoints on the road and Beeminder will always be free.
    Go off the road and you (literally) pay the price.
    </p>

    <h1>How is Beeminder different?</h1>
    <p>
    Beeminder is Quantified Self plus Commitment contracts.
    If you just want self-tracking you have
    <a href="http://blog.beeminder.com/trackhack"
       title="Beeminder blog post about services for tracking data without the commitment device aspect. It's not exactly up to date though.">a lot of choices</a>
    and if you just want commitment devices you have
    <a href="http://blog.beeminder.com/competitors"
       title="Beeminder blog post (kept continually up to date) about all the Beeminder competitors we know of">more and more options</a>
    as well
    (<a href="http://stickk.com"
        title="Tagline: Put a contract out on yourself">StickK</a>
    is our biggest competitor). 
    Beeminder combines self-tracking and commitment contracts:
    keep all your datapoints on a Yellow Brick Road to your goal or
    <a href="http://beeminder.com/money"
       title="Details on Beeminder's pricing. Always free (with no need to even enter a credit card) if you never go off track on your goals!">we take your money</a>.
    The combination is powerful.
    We call it
    <a href="http://blog.beeminder.com/flexbind"
       title="In short, to make the optimal tradeoff between commitment and flexibility, you should frame commitments in terms of Quantified Self data and have the commitment only ever apply in a one-week horizon. So can always quit or change what you've committed to but only in a week from now, a timeframe your laziness/impetuousness typically does not extend to.">flexible self-control</a>.

    <h1>Who is Beeminder for?</h1>
    <p>
    Here's the way to find out if Beeminder could be useful for you:
    Is there anything you know you should do,
    you really do want to do,
    you know for certain you <i>can</i> do,
    yet that historically you don't do?
    (Also, are you a nerdy, lifehacking data freak?)
    If yes, you should try it!

    <h1>Beeminding your weight</h1>
    <p>
    The most popular Beeminder goal is weight loss.
    We're proud of how well it works and have put a lot of thought into
    the data smoothing and other features.
    The problem with beeminding something that has random fluctuation is that it's
    discouraging and/or nerve-racking to see the numbers bounce around day-to-day,
    which is why weight-loss programs typically only ask for weekly weigh-ins.
    But if you have a random up day on a
    <a href="http://blog.beeminder.com/weighly">weekly weigh-in</a> day,
    that's <i>really</i> discouraging.
    Better to get more data and let Beeminder show you the true trend.
    And you get daily instead of weekly feedback. That's key.
    And that's where the different parts of the graph come in, such as the turquoise
    swath which you can think of as a very thick line charting your progress or an
    aura around your actual data.
    It gives you a sense of your true trend.
    </p>
    <p>
    This person's graph illustrates this nicely:
    </p>
    <a href="/example/weight2"><img src="/example/weight2/graph?style=thumb" alt="Graph?style=thumb" /></a>
    <p>
    They bounce around a lot but it's clear that their true trend is twice as steep
    as their road.

    <h3>Yellow Brick Road</h3>
    <p>
    The most important feature of a Beeminder graph is the yellow brick road.
    It shows you where you're going.
    Keep your dots on the road and
    <a href="http://beeminder.com/money">Beeminder will remain free</a>.
    The true ideal road is actually the dotted orange centerline but the road is
    calculated to be wide enough so that as long as your dots are on the road
    then your deviation from the ideal centerline is probably random.
    It's quite generous about this so being off the road means you're definitely in
    arrears.

    <h3>Beeminding everything else</h3>
    <p>
    You're here because you want to accomplish something and you need a tool to help make sure you put in the kind of consistent effort over an extended period of time necessary to achieve this goal.
    Beeminder is a tool that helps you hold yourself accountable to making regular progress towards your goals, but is also flexible enough for the unpredictability and messiness of the real world.
    </p>
    <p>
    Sure, for some goals, like flossing your teeth, you can just resolve to do it every single day.
    But what about if you want to read more?
    You could resolve to read, say, 20 pages every day.
    But some days you'll have more time to read.
    That's where Beeminder comes in.
    Beeminder helps you make consistent progress towards your goal, even when life is anything but consistent.
    When you create a goal in Beeminder, you commit to making progress at a certain minimum rate.
    For example, let's say that you decide you want to read an average of 20 pages a day, or 140 pages a week.
    Some days, you may read 100 pages, while other days you may not read any.
    Simply tell Beeminder how many pages you read, and Beeminder will graph your progress [TODO: show example graph] and warn you when you're in danger of “derailing”, or slipping below the minimum rate you set for yourself.
    Not only is Beeminder flexible between days, it is also adaptable to changing circumstances and priorities.
    Say you know you're about to enter a busy period at work and won't have as much time to read.
    You can lower your rate from 20 pages a day, or 140 pages a week, to 5 pages a day, or 35 pages a week.
    Obviously you're probably not going to read exactly 5 pages every day.
    More likely you'll read the necessary 35 pages in one or two sittings, so you'll have more time to spend on your other priorities.
    When things calm down again, you can raise the rate back up to where it was before.
    But here's the thing!
    We designed Beeminder to be flexible when it comes to what days you do something and understanding when you need to adjust your goal rate.
    However, we also designed Beeminder to help you stick to your resolutions!
    </p>
    <p>
    If you slip below the minimum rate you set for yourself, Beeminder will “sting” you by charging your credit card, first for $5, but the amount charged (the “pledge”) increases each time you derail.
    Don’t worry though!
    We give you every opportunity to avoid derailing.
    We will send you email reminders when you start to come close to danger, and you can enter new data by replying to that email or by using our mobile app or our website.
    And whenever you derail, we send you a legitimacy check email.
    If you derailed for a good reason, such as a power outage or an error in data input, simply explain what happened and we will undo the derailment and you won't be charged.
    </p>
    <p>
    But wait! Can't I just lie to avoid the punishment? Well, yes.
    Most of our users are honest and can't lie to us with a straight face, so our default policy is to simply take your word for it.
    This is our business, but we only want to take your money if we deserve it!
    Besides, the whole point of having the threat of losing this money is to motivate you, so if you don't pay, then you lose this motivating factor.
    If you know you're going to be tempted to make up an excuse, then you can check our “weaselproof me” checkbox ahead of time, and we'll require documentation such as a doctor's note or confirmation from any listed “supporters” who you set to be CC’d upon a derailment.
    If you check this box, we also disable your ability to edit or manually add data to goals with automatic data input, such as Fitbit steps.
    Finally, regardless of whether you check this box or not, we don't let you change rates instantaneously, otherwise you could always decide to change your goal at the last minute.
    Instead, changes in your minimum rate take effect in a week, so plan ahead!
    </p>
    <p>
    Okay, we've covered a lot of ground in this video [TODO: make this a video?], but actually using Beeminder is really simple.
    Create a goal [TODO: picture], set a rate, and just stay above (or below, in some cases) the “yellow brick road”!
    </p>
    <p>
    It sounds so simple, but our users have used Beeminder to lose a hundred pounds [TODO: link], to write a novel [TODO: link], to run the distance between New York and California last year [TODO: link], and much much more.
    What will you do?

    &copy; Beeminder 2011&ndash;2020
<!--
Danny and Bee and Andy argue about automatically setting the copyright year to 2020:

D: boo to automatically filling in copyright! that's how we prove we're still at the wheel :)
A: it only proves that if it's publicly visible how the copyright is being created
A: like if beeminder were open source. otherwise no one can tell the difference
D: actually i think when the copyright changes at a random time in january, that's a good signal that you're at the wheel...
D: if it changes at the stroke of midnight then obviously you cheated and could all be dead or on a beach somewhere
B: but everyone cheats
B: so it can only be an indicator in our absence
D: boo to cheaters
bystander: it's the best way to score GitHub points too: open `2017` -> `2018` pull requests
A: but who is going around checking exactly when copyrights change??
A: bots, that's who
A: okay nevermind I'm on board with this as a precaution to confuse future overlords
B: anyhow, it also makes us look stupid. like we don't know how to use string format, and causes people to write us emails like "Umm. so your copyright is out of date. I don't know what language you guys use, but in php it's really easy you.."
A: maybe that's a positive, identify users who can write code
A: "oh, thanks! here's another nerd sniping problem. can you rewrite beebrain?"
D: clearly the optimal solution is to set it to `year(now-random(5,10)*86400)` :)
D: (simulates a fairly attentive human at the wheel updating the copyright 5-10 days after new years)
D: i can't tell what fraction serious i am about doing it manually. i guess if, counterfactually, we ever weren't at the wheel it would be lies and that feels icky
D: like there's something inherently dishonest about literally being like "copyright... uh, whatever year it is when you're reading this!"
B: ok, so part of the checklist for shuttering beeminder is "update footer copyright date"
B: you clearly didn't understand my argument for why we're doing this, because you seem to remain unconvinced. go read my email again and then i'm putting you in timeout so you can think about what you've done.
D: [pastes this in the html source so we can show it to people in 2021 who see "2020" and think we don't know how to insert a dynamic date]
PS: Bee's argument in the email with the user who called us out:
I think Danny had some convoluted reasoning for why we shouldn't just make that programmatic, like "it's a signal that the site is still active", but I think that's kind of incorrect -- anyone writing a website can make the copyright date be programmatically generated, so it doesn't actually serve as any indicator of currency, it can only serve as a anti-activity signal by going out of date.
