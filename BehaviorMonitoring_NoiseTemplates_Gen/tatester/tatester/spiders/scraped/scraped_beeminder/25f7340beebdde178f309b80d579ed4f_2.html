  <h2 class="qst" id="qnam">
  <a href="#qnam">Q:</a>
  Why the name Beeminder?
  </h2>
  <p>
  Beeminder reminds you and binds you.
  It&#8217;s Beeminder, the
  <a href="http://blog.beeminder.com/akrasia" title="Inaugural blog post: 'How To Do What You Want: Akrasia and Self-Binding'">me-binder</a>.
  It&#8217;s reminders with a sting.
  Mind your goals, and be minded.
  Oh, and our esteemed co-founder,
  <a href="http://beesoule.com" title="CTO and Queen Bee">Bethany Soule</a>,
  goes by &#8220;Bee&#8221;.
  </p>
  <p>
  For the full story, including the story of our previous name, Kibotzer, check out our blog:
  <a href="http://blog.beeminder.com/beenamer" title="Also discusses our CEO's onomastic manifesto, 'Nominology', if you really like geeking out about names">blog.beeminder.com/beenamer</a>.
  </p>


  <h2 class="qst" id="qset">
  <a href="#qset">Q:</a>
  How do I set up a goal?
  </h2>
  <p>
  Click the red New Goal button.
  The key choice to make when creating a goal is the initial weekly rate.
  That&#8217;s the steepness of your Yellow Brick Road, how much you&#8217;re committing to do per week, in whatever units you&#8217;ll be reporting in.
  For example, for weight loss, if you want to lose half a pound a week, that&#8217;s a weekly rate of -0.5.
  For 3 workouts per week where you&#8217;ll enter a 1 for every workout (a Do More goal) that&#8217;s a weekly rate of 3.
  For 30 minutes of exercise per day, that&#8217;s 210 minutes per week, or 3.5 if you&#8217;ll be reporting hours, which is probably
  <a href="#qcut" title="Jump to the FAQ item for data entry shortcuts">more convenient</a>.
  We recommend picking a very conservative rate at first because you can adjust the steepness as you go with the
  <a href="#qtwo" title="Jump to the FAQ item about the road dial">Road Dial</a>
  beneath your graph.
  For more on this you might like the

  <h2 class="qst" id="qser">
  <a href="#qser">Q:</a>
  What services and gadgets do you integrate with?
  </h2>
  <p>
  Those are all listed on the front page of beeminder.com!
  And
  <a href="http://forum.beeminder.com/t/hard-committing-to-the-next-batch-of-autodata-integrations/420" title="Forum post: hard-committing to the next batch of autodata integrations">in the forum</a>
  we list third-party integrations, integrations you can set up via IFTTT/Zapier, and upcoming integrations.
  </p>

<h2 class="qst" id="qent">
<a href="#qent">Q:</a>
How do I enter data?
</h2>
<p>
Enter data on your dashboard (click the the '&gt;' arrow next to the goal for the data entry form).
You can also enter your data next to your graph on the graph page.
Or you can answer the emails from bot@beeminder.com or
<a href="http://blog.beeminder.com/textbot" title="'Buzzing BeeBot'">text (SMS) your data to the bot</a>.
You can enter multiple datapoints at once and you can reply to any email from the bot with data for any day, or multiple days.
Finally, we&#8217;re adding more and more devices and apps that can automatically send data to Beeminder.
Stay tuned!
</p><p>
We even have
<a href="http://blog.beeminder.com/api" title="Blog post announcing our API, with lots of examples of cool things people are doing with it">an API</a>
which many people use to automate their beeminding in

</p>


  <h2 class="qst" id="qcom">
  <a href="#qcom">Q:</a>
  How do the commitment contracts work?
  </h2>
  <p>
  Check out our
  <a href="http://beeminder.com/money" title="Also includes a list of pointers to questions here in the FAQ that are about money">pricing page</a>
  and our
  <a href="http://beeminder.com/contract" title="We spent a ton of time on this in the early days and now find that pretty much no one pays attention to it at all...">standard contract template</a>.
  The short answer: you keep all your datapoints on your yellow brick road and if you ever don&#8217;t then we collect the amount you pledged.
  By default we also automatically put you back on the hook at a higher pledge amount but with time to opt out of that.
  </p>


  <h2 class="qst" id="qtm">
  <a href="#qtm">Q:</a>
  When exactly do I derail from not reporting?
  </h2>
  <p>
  That&#8217;s what &#8220;safe days&#8221; or the &#8220;safety buffer&#8221; is telling you.
  You should try to keep your datapoints on the road at all times but if you start the day on the wrong side of the road (in the red) you have until
  <a href="http://blog.beeminder.com/deadlines" title="You can change the deadline from midnight if you choose">midnight that night</a>
  to get back on.
  We call that a &#8220;beemergency&#8221;.
  </p>


  <h2 class="qst" id="qfrz">
  <a href="#qfrz">Q:</a>
  What exactly happens when I derail?
  </h2>
  <p>
  You get an email asking if the derailment was legit.
  If you had money pledged, the charge will automatically go through 24 hours later.
  </p><p>
  By default (you can customize this in Goal Settings) you will then be automatically rerailed at a higher pledge amount (up to whatever pledge cap you set) and with a week of safety buffer.
  That&#8217;s enough time to adjust the amount at risk.
  </p><p>
  At any point you can hit Archive on a goal to cry uncle.
  That takes a week to take effect but if you happen to derail while the archiving is pending then the goal will freeze, i.e., not automatically rerail.
  (And then when the actual archiving happens, the goal will disappear from your gallery.)
  </p>


  <h2 class="qst" id="qeli5">
  <a href="#qeli5">Q:</a>
  I&#8217;m confused. Can you explain like I&#8217;m 5?

  What if I don&#8217;t know exactly what I want my goal to be yet, but I want to get started tracking?
  </h2>
  <p>
  Beeminder is great for that!
  Set up a goal and pick something ridiculously easy as your initial rate.
  For example, -0.001 pounds per week for weight loss &#8212; essentially flat.
  Or one workout every other week (weekly rate 0.5).
  Then when you get a sense of what&#8217;s realistic you can dial up the steepness of your road.
  </p>


  <h2 class="qst" id="qinf">
  <a href="#qinf">Q:</a>
  What if I want to do something less often than daily?
  </h2>
  <p>
  Beeminder works well for things that you do in bursts or infrequent chunks.
  Check out our blog post &mdash;
  <a href="http://blog.beeminder.com/chunky" title="Yet another link to our blog. We're exceedingly proud of blog. You should read the whole thing.">Chunky Time</a>
  &mdash; about this.
  The short version is: once you do one session, you&#8217;ll be far above the road with plenty of safety buffer to get to your next session.
  If you can&#8217;t do one session within the next day or two, check the box to start with a flat spot on your yellow brick road.
  </p>


  <h2 class="qst" id="qtwo">
  <a href="#qtwo">Q:</a>
  Why can I only change two of the parameters at the bottom of my graph and one is grayed out?
  </h2>
  <p>
  Those three fields comprise what we call the
  <a href="http://blog.beeminder.com/dial" title="'The Road Dial and the Akrasia Horizon'">Road Dial</a>.
  It&#8217;s how you change the steepness of your yellow brick road, i.e., how you make the goal easier or harder.
  </p>
  <p>
  The reason one field &mdash; goal date, goal value, or rate &mdash; is grayed out is that specifying two implies the third.
  Specifying an amount and a date implies a necessary rate to get there in time.
  Likewise rate & date imply amount, and amount & rate imply date.
  It&#8217;s math, yo.
  We only let you give two at a time and Beeminder figures out the third for you to make sure your goal is self-consistent.
  You choose which one Beeminder infers by exing/graying it out.
  </p>
  <p>
  It&#8217;s especially handy if you&#8217;re not sure what you want to commit to.
  You can experiment, for example, like this:
  &#8220;If I lose a pound a week till Christmas I&#8217;ll weigh&#8230; 160 pounds?
  What if I want to weigh 140 pounds by Christmas? Two pounds per week?
  That&#8217;s too much, but how long till I hit 140 at -1.5 per week?
  March 15. Ok, what if I just go for 140 by <em>next</em> Christmas?&#8221;
  Etc.

  <p>
  Datapoints on these graphs are automatically summed and it&#8217;s the cumulative total that&#8217;s plotted.
  If today is the 28th and you enter 28 2 and later 28 3, that&#8217;s the same as entering 28 5 one time.
  Do More goals and Do Less goals are auto-summing.

  <h2 class="qst" id="qcut">
  <a href="#qcut">Q:</a>
  Any shortcuts for entering data?
  </h2>
  <p>
  Normally you enter the day of the month followed by the value for that day.
  If you find it annoying to remember what day of the month it is, you can use a caret to mean &#8220;today&#8221; and a double-caret for &#8220;yesterday&#8221; (any number of carets work, in fact):
  <pre>
  ^^ 200
   ^ 199 "lost a pound since yesterday!"
  </pre>
  Note that you can enter as many datapoints at a time as you like, one per line.
  (Also, spacing doesn&#8217;t matter. But the quotation marks do.)
  </p><p>
  There are also a couple shortcuts for entering the values.
  If you&#8217;re recording amounts of time you can enter, for example, 1:30 and it will be translated as 1.5.
  Similarly for amounts of time as H:M:S.
  And if you&#8217;re British you can enter a weight as, for example, 10st5 and it will be recorded as 145.
  If you&#8217;re not British then you now think Brits are even more bizarre than you thought previously!
  </p><p>
  All of these shortcuts &mdash; carets, colons, and stones &mdash; are just that:
  shortcuts for entering data.
  Beeminder receives your datapoint as if you had entered the equivalent
  <em>day-of-month</em> <em>number</em> version.
  </p>


  <h2 class="qst" id="qdat">
  <a href="#qdat">Q:</a>
  What if just the day of the month could be ambiguous? Can I specify the whole date, like “2014 06 28” instead of just “28”?
  </h2>
  <p>
  You can but the format we support is in flux right now so we&#8217;d rather you stick to just entering the day of the month, as in the initial example datapoint.
  Beeminder intelligently disambiguates, almost always correctly guessing the year and month you must have meant.
  <!-- In fact, we challenge you to break it! -->
  (If you're importing data, or have more than, say, a week's worth of data to add, see the next question about importing data.)
  </p>


<h2 class="qst" id="qimp">
<a href="#qimp">Q:</a>
Can I export my data? How about importing existing data?
</h2>
<p>
Yes and yes. 
(Well, you can only import data to manual entry goals.)
This is a big deal to us and has been available from day one.
Go to the Data tab for your goal and look for the Export section toward the very bottom to export your data as CSV or TSV.
We even offer <em>streaming</em> export so every datapoint that Beeminder gets it will immediately make a callback to a URL of your choosing (set it in advanced settings) so you can keep a realtime mirror of your data.
You can also get your data as JSON via
<a href="http:/beeminder.com/api" title="We have an API! Code things!">our API</a>.
</p><p>
You can paste as much data as you like into the Advanced Entry form next to your graph (see the Import Data section in the Data tab below your graph for details).

  <a href="#qsec">Q:</a>
  What does consecutive days of data have to do with the width of the road?

  <p>
  This is in flux but here&#8217;s the current answer:
  You need to have consecutive days of data for the road width algorithm to be as lenient as possible.
  Road width is how we account for random fluctuations while still keeping you on track to your ultimate goal.

  <a href="#qodo">Q:</a>
  What if my odometer (or &#8220;odometer&#8221;) gets reset?

  Ok, this is a rarely asked question, but it comes up, and Beeminder has a clever solution!
  (Note that this is only for Odometer goals.)
  Just enter a datapoint with a value of zero and Beeminder will take that to mean an accidental odometer reset and continue tracking your cumulative total despite the drop in your reported values.
  </p><p>
  This is also handy if you&#8217;re beeminding the number of pages you read.
  Just report your current page number and, when you reach the end of one book, report a 0 before you start reporting your current page number in the next book.
  That way Beeminder keeps tracking your total pages without you needing to do any mental arithmetic.

  <a href="#qfwl">Q:</a>
  How fast can I lose weight?
  </h2>
  <p>
  The maximum healthy rate we recommend &mdash; and this is far from easy &mdash; is one percent of your bodyweight per week.
  We recommend starting with a more modest 0.33% per week.
  That corresponds, for example, to half a pound per week if you weigh 150 pounds, or a deficit of 250 calories per day.
  Since you want to target a percentage of your current weight, that means as you lose weight you want the steepness of your yellow brick road to decrease.
  </p>


<h2 class="qst" id="qflx">
<a href="#qflx">Q:</a>
What if I derail due to natural fluctuation in my weight?
</h2>
<p>
When you create a weight loss goal we ask you for the most your weight can 
fluctuate in a day and start you with that much leeway.
From then on it's up to you to maintain as much safety buffer as you need to make sure a natural fluctuation in your weight does derail you.
</p><p>
We&#8217;ve done our best to strike the right balance between allowing for natural fluctuation vs making sure that you can&#8217;t deceive yourself that you&#8217;re making progress when you&#8217;re really not.
It&#8217;s a tricky problem and we&#8217;re eager for more feedback on this but we have enough success stories that we believe that &mdash; if you pay attention to where you are on the yellow brick road every day &mdash; that derailing truly means you were not following the path you set for yourself.

  <h2 class="qst" id="qstk">
  <a href="#qstk">Q:</a>
  Why should I use Beeminder instead of <a href="http://stickk.com" title="Our esteemed competitor">StickK</a>?
  </h2>
  <p>
  Beeminder is, in our humble opinions, far superior to StickK for graphable goals.
  And it&#8217;s not just our pretty graphs or our data import/export or bot reminders.
  More fundamentally it&#8217;s that Beeminder understands that commitment contracts suck.
  You&#8217;ve probably noticed that you often (ironically) procrastinate on using them, even when you see the clear need.
  What sucks is the loss of flexibility &mdash; maybe losing weight will be more painful than you think, maybe something will come up at work.
  So many unknowns.
  Committing is scary (and rationally so!).
  </p><p>
  Beeminder offers the the best of both worlds:
  <a href="http://blog.beeminder.com/flexbind" title="'Flexible Self-Control'">meaningful commitment with maximal flexibility</a>.
  Beeminding means committing to
  <a href="http://blog.beeminder.com/roadwidth" title="'The Magical Widening Yellow Brick Road'">keep your datapoints on your yellow brick road</a>,
  but the steepness of the road is under your control, with a one-week delay.
  </p><p>
  Why a week?
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrasia" title="">Akrasia</a>
  (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_inconsistency" title="Wikipedia's take on Dynamic Inconsistency">dynamic inconsistency</a>,
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_discounting" title="Wikipedia's take on Hyperbolic Discounting">hyperbolic discounting</a>)
  means over-weighting immediate consequences, so to beat akrasia you only need to bind yourself for whatever the horizon on &#8220;immediate&#8221; is.
  Based on a study of grocery-buying habits &mdash; when buying groceries online for delivery tomorrow people buy a lot more ice cream and a lot fewer vegetables than when they&#8217;re ordering for delivery next week &mdash; and raw guesswork (so far), we&#8217;re taking that Akrasia Horizon to be one week.
  </p>
  <p>
  In short: Don&#8217;t dogmatically stickK to your goals, beemind them!
  </p>


  <h2 class="qst" id="qben">
  <a href="#qben">Q:</a>
  Can I specify a beneficiary of my commitment contract?

  <p>
  No, collecting the fees is our business model.
  Of course, that was
  <a href="http://stickk.com" title="Our esteemed competitor">StickK.com</a>&#8217;s
  original plan and they concluded that people wouldn&#8217;t go for that so they now let you specify beneficiaries of your contract.
  We may need to do the same, and we&#8217;re definitely eager to
  <a href="http://beeminder.com/contact" title="Our contact form, with various ways to reach us, including just emailing support@beeminder.com">hear feedback about that</a>.
  But our thinking is: <br/>
  1. The <a href="http://beeminder.com/money" title="Also includes a list of pointers to questions here in the FAQ that are about money">exponential fee schedule</a>
  makes a big difference.
  In addition to removing the difficult choice about how much to pledge, it makes it feel more reasonable for Beeminder to be the beneficiary.
  You&#8217;re starting with a small amount pledged after you&#8217;ve already gotten value out of Beeminder.<br/>
  2. We think we&#8217;re fundamentally providing more value than StickK because of the pretty graphs and storing your data &mdash; another justification for us being the beneficiary of the contracts.
  <br/>
  3. We do have a charity option as part of our most expensive <a href="https://www.beeminder.com/premium" title="The plans are Infinibee, Bee Plus, and Beemium">premium plan</a>.
  </p><p>
  We now have many thousands of goals with money pledged and it seems to be universally true that whenever someone actually pays a pledge, they got at least that much value out of Beeminder up until that point.

  <br/>
  Though not required, we recommend you follow that exponential schedule so that you can quickly find the amount of money that motivates you to reach your goal.

  </p>


  <h2 class="qst" id="qdub">
  <a href="#qdub">Q:</a>
  Why not just double the amount pledged each time?
  </h2>
  <p>
  The idea is that you want to very quickly reach an amount that motivates you to take your yellow brick road seriously.
  At first we thought we&#8217;d just double the amount each time but then realized that that means that by the time you&#8217;ve found your Motivation Point, you&#8217;ve actually wasted approximately that same amount in previously paid fees.
  That sucks since by definition the Motivation Point is a scary amount that you definitely don&#8217;t want to lose.
  Yet by the time that amount is motivating you, you&#8217;ve accumulated that much in losses!
  So we wanted it to increase more steeply.
  With the above schedule you&#8217;ll never waste more than half of the amount that eventually motivates you to stay on track.

  Think of this as how wide the Yellow Brick Road should be so that
  if your true values were all right on the centerline, 90% of your actual
  values (with random fluctuations) would be on the road.
  Technically: This is the 90% quantile of the
  rate-adjusted daily absolute variations in your data.
  (E.g., if the delta between two consecutive days is equal to the
  delta of the road itself, that&#8217;s a rate-adjusted delta of 0.
  And, yes, &#8220;90% variance&#8221; isn&#8217;t a thing.
  We mean variance as in how much your values vary, relative to the road,
  day-to-day, in the 90% worst case.)

  <div class="copyright">
    &copy; Beeminder 2011&ndash;2020
<!--
Danny and Bee and Andy argue about automatically setting the copyright year to 2020:

D: boo to automatically filling in copyright! that's how we prove we're still at the wheel :)
A: it only proves that if it's publicly visible how the copyright is being created
A: like if beeminder were open source. otherwise no one can tell the difference
D: actually i think when the copyright changes at a random time in january, that's a good signal that you're at the wheel...
D: if it changes at the stroke of midnight then obviously you cheated and could all be dead or on a beach somewhere
B: but everyone cheats
B: so it can only be an indicator in our absence
D: boo to cheaters
bystander: it's the best way to score GitHub points too: open `2017` -> `2018` pull requests
A: but who is going around checking exactly when copyrights change??
A: bots, that's who
A: okay nevermind I'm on board with this as a precaution to confuse future overlords
B: anyhow, it also makes us look stupid. like we don't know how to use string format, and causes people to write us emails like "Umm. so your copyright is out of date. I don't know what language you guys use, but in php it's really easy you.."
A: maybe that's a positive, identify users who can write code
A: "oh, thanks! here's another nerd sniping problem. can you rewrite beebrain?"
D: clearly the optimal solution is to set it to `year(now-random(5,10)*86400)` :)
D: (simulates a fairly attentive human at the wheel updating the copyright 5-10 days after new years)
D: i can't tell what fraction serious i am about doing it manually. i guess if, counterfactually, we ever weren't at the wheel it would be lies and that feels icky
D: like there's something inherently dishonest about literally being like "copyright... uh, whatever year it is when you're reading this!"
B: ok, so part of the checklist for shuttering beeminder is "update footer copyright date"
B: you clearly didn't understand my argument for why we're doing this, because you seem to remain unconvinced. go read my email again and then i'm putting you in timeout so you can think about what you've done.
D: [pastes this in the html source so we can show it to people in 2021 who see "2020" and think we don't know how to insert a dynamic date]
PS: Bee's argument in the email with the user who called us out:
I think Danny had some convoluted reasoning for why we shouldn't just make that programmatic, like "it's a signal that the site is still active", but I think that's kind of incorrect -- anyone writing a website can make the copyright date be programmatically generated, so it doesn't actually serve as any indicator of currency, it can only serve as a anti-activity signal by going out of date.
