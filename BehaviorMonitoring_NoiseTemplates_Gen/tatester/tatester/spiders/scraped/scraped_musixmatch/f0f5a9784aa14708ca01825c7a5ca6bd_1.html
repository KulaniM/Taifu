Should you not accept these amendments, you may terminate the Services.</p><p>7.8 If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under these Terms, or if we do not enforce our rights against you or if we delay in doing so this does not mean that we have waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you.</p><p>7.9 A person who is not a party to these Terms shall not have any rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 or otherwise to enforce any of these Terms.</p><p><strong><br/></strong></p><p>See also our <a href="http://about.musixmatch.com/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="http://about.musixmatch.com/cookie-policy">Cookie Policy</a>.</p><p><strong><br/><br/></strong></p><p>Last Updated May 2018</p><p>‍</p></div></div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="mxm-container w-clearfix"><div class="footer-column footer-column-logo"><a href="https://musixmatch.com" class="link-block-5 w-inline-block"><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5c5b0a009abbac199b244792/5c62aaff5e0efd34823a9f2d_logo-dark.png" width="160" alt=""/></a><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/it/eventi/?sc_channel=TA&amp;sc_campaign=musixmatch_IT&amp;sc_publisher=musixmatch&amp;sc_medium=website&amp;sc_content=IT_landingpage&amp;sc_country=IT" target="_blank" class="link-block-6 w-inline-block"><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5c5b0a009abbac199b244792/5cab8242f8e012013fe9260c_amazon-logo-black1%402x.png" width="100" alt=""/></a></div><div class="footer-column"><h4 class="heading-14">Company</h4><ul class="w-list-unstyled"><li><a href="/" class="footer-nav-item">About us</a></li><li class="list-item"><a href="/careers" class="footer-nav-item">Careers</a></li><li class="list-item"><a href="/press" class="footer-nav-item">Press</a></li><li><a href="/contacts" class="footer-nav-item">Contact</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.musixmatch.com" target="_blank" class="footer-nav-item">Blog</a></li></ul></div><div class="footer-column"><h4 class="heading-13">Products</h4><ul class="w-list-unstyled"><li><a href="/business/overview" class="footer-nav-item">Business Solutions</a></li><li class="list-item"><a href="/apps" class="footer-nav-item">Apps</a></li><li class="list-item"><a href="https://developer.musixmatch.com" target="_blank" class="footer-nav-item">Developer Tools</a></li><li class="list-item"><a href="/publishers/musixmatch-for-publishers" target="_blank" class="footer-nav-item">Musixmatch for Publishers</a></li></ul></div><div class="footer-column footer-column-last"><h4 class="heading-15">Community</h4><ul class="w-list-unstyled"><li><a href="/community/overview" class="footer-nav-item">Overview</a></li><li class="list-item"><a href="/community/guidelines" class="footer-nav-item">Guidelines</a></li><li class="list-item"><a href="/artists/verified-artist" class="footer-nav-item">Verified Artists</a></li><li><a href="/community/become-a-curator" class="footer-nav-item">Become a Curator</a></li><li><a href="https://support.musixmatch.com/" class="footer-nav-item">Help Center</a></li><li><a href="https://support.musixmatch.com/article/115-im-a-user-how-do-i-contact-other-members-of-the-musixmatch-community" target="_blank" class="footer-nav-item">Ask the Community</a></li></ul></div><div class="div-block-28"><div class="footer-end"><div class="w-row"><div class="w-col w-col-3 w-col-tiny-tiny-stack"><div class="text-block-2">Musixmatch </div></div><div class="column-20 w-col w-col-5 w-col-tiny-tiny-stack"><a href="/privacy-policy" class="footer-terms">Privacy Policy</a><a href="/cookie-policy" class="footer-terms">Cookie Policy</a><a href="/eula" aria-current="page" class="footer-terms w--current">EULA</a><a href="/copyright" class="footer-terms">Copyright</a></div><div class="w-col w-col-4 w-col-tiny-tiny-stack"><div class="text-block-3">🇮🇹  Made with love &amp; passion in Italy  🌎  Enjoyed everywhere</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><script src="https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/js/jquery-3.4.1.min.220afd743d.js?site=5c5b0a009abbac199b244792" type="text/javascript" integrity="sha256-CSXorXvZcTkaix6Yvo6HppcZGetbYMGWSFlBw8HfCJo=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://assets.website-files.com/5c5b0a009abbac199b244792/js/corporate-2847c1.97185fdd6.js" type="text/javascript"></script><!--[if lte IE 9]><script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/placeholders/3.0.2/placeholders.min.js"></script><![endif]--></body></html>
