                    <p>Our goal is to provide helpful and accurate information on the Fitbit Service, but we make no endorsement, representation, or warranty of any kind about any Fitbit Content, information, or services. The accuracy of the data collected and presented through the Fitbit Service is not intended to match that of medical devices or scientific measurement devices.</p>
                    <p>We are not responsible for the accuracy, reliability, availability, effectiveness or correct use of information you receive through the Fitbit Service. Fitbit Content and the Fitbit Service may change from time to time or vary by geographic location.

                    <p>Use of the Fitbit Service should not replace your good judgement and common sense. Please read and comply with all safety notices that accompany your use of the Fitbit Service, including those located on our <a href="/sg/productcare">Wear and Care</a> page.</p>

                    <h2>11. CONSULT YOUR DOCTOR BEFORE USING THE FITBIT SERVICE</h2>
                    <p>The Fitbit Service is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. If you have a medical or heart condition, consult your doctor before using the Fitbit Service, engaging in an exercise program, or changing your diet. If you experience a medical emergency, stop using the Fitbit Service and consult with a medical professional. We are not responsible for any health problems that may result from training programs, consultations, products, or events you learn about through the Fitbit Service. If you engage in any exercise program you receive or learn about through the Fitbit Service, you agree that you do so at your own risk and are voluntarily participating in these activities.</p>
                    <p>Prolonged contact with wearable devices may contribute to skin irritation or allergies in some users. To reduce irritation, follow four simple wear and care tips: (1) keep it clean, (2) keep it dry, (3) don&#x2019;t wear it too tight, and (4) give your wrist a rest by removing the band for an hour after extended wear. For more information visit <a href="/sg/productcare">www.fitbit.com/productcare</a>. If you notice any skin irritation, soreness, tingling, numbness, burning or stiffness in your hands or wrists while or after wearing the product, remove your device and please discontinue use. If any symptoms persist longer than 2-3 days after removing the device, consult your doctor.</p>
                    <p>Fitbit products using PurePulse technology have a heart rate tracking feature that may pose risks to users with certain health conditions. Consult your doctor prior to use of such products if you (1) have a medical or heart condition, (2) are taking any photosensitive medicine, (3) have epilepsy or are sensitive to flashing lights, (4) have reduced circulation or bruise easily, or (5) have tendonitis, carpal tunnel syndrome, or other musculoskeletal disorders.</p>

                    <h2>23. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>
                    <p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH US AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.</p>
                    <p>You agree that any dispute between you and Fitbit arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service, the Fitbit Service, or any other Fitbit products or services (collectively, &#x201C;Disputes&#x201D;) will be governed by the arbitration procedure outlined below.</p>
                    <p>Governing Law: Except as otherwise required by applicable law, the Terms of Service and the resolution of any Disputes shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws principles.</p>
                    <p>Informal Dispute Resolution: We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against Fitbit, you agree to try to resolve the Dispute informally by contacting <a href="mailto:support@fitbit.com">support@fitbit.com</a>. We will try to resolve the Dispute informally by contacting you via email. If a dispute is not resolved within 15 days after submission, you or Fitbit may bring formal proceedings.</p>
                    <p>We Both Agree To Arbitrate: You and Fitbit agree to resolve any Disputes through final and binding arbitration, except as set forth under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below.</p>
                    <p>Opt-out of Agreement to Arbitrate: You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by contacting <a href="mailto:optout@fitbit.com">optout@fitbit.com</a> within 30 days of first accepting these Terms of Service and stating that you (include your first and last name) decline this arbitration agreement.</p>
                    <p>Arbitration Procedures: The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. The arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live or work, San Francisco, California, or any other location we agree to.</p>
                    <p>Arbitration Fees: The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. Fitbit will pay all arbitration fees for claims of less than US$75,000. Fitbit will not seek its legal fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.</p>
                    <p>Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate: Either you or Fitbit may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Francisco (CA) or any United States county where you live or work. Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorised use or abuse of the Fitbit products or Fitbit Service, or infringement of intellectual property rights (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above.</p>
                    <p>No Class Actions: You may only resolve Disputes with Fitbit on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class (collective), consolidated or representative action. Class arbitrations, class (collective) action lawsuits, private general lawsuits through a solicitor, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed under our agreement.</p>
                    <p>Judicial Forum for Disputes: Except as otherwise required by applicable law, in the event that the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you and Fitbit agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the federal or state courts of San Francisco County, California, USA. Both you and Fitbit consent to the venue and personal jurisdiction there. We both agree to waive our right to a jury trial.</p>
                    <p>Limitation on Claims: Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to your use of the Fitbit products or Fitbit Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose, or else that claim or cause of action will be barred forever.</p>

                    <h2>24. GENERAL TERMS</h2>

                    <h2>1. THE FITBIT PAY SERVICE</h2>
                    <p>Fitbit Pay is a service offered by Fitbit that enables you to use a supported Fitbit device (a &#x201C;Supported Device&#x201D;) to complete transactions at compatible contactless terminals. If you have a Supported Device, you may store a virtual version of credit cards, debit cards, or other types of supported cards identified by Fitbit from time to time (each, a &#x201C;Card&#x201D;) on your Supported Device.</p>
                    <p>
                        Fitbit Pay may be available only in select regions. In order to use Fitbit Pay, you must have a Card from a bank that supports Fitbit Pay. Participating banks may change over time and a bank may cease supporting Fitbit Pay without notice to you. The features of Fitbit Pay may vary depending on your region and bank. <a href="https://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/2236">Click here</a> for additional information on Fitbit Pay.
                    </p>
                    <p>In order to use Fitbit Pay, you must have a Fitbit account, the Fitbit mobile app, a Supported Device, and a supported Card from a participating bank. To load a Card onto your Supported Device, you must first enter your Card information into the Fitbit mobile app; you will also be prompted to set a PIN number if you have not already done so. Once your Card has been verified as eligible for use with Fitbit Pay, you must sync to your Supported Device to enable use of your Card on your Supported Device. As part of adding a card to Fitbit Pay, you will accept any terms, conditions, and policies provided by your Card&#x2019;s bank (&#x201C;Bank Terms&#x201D;), and such Bank Terms will apply to your use of the Card through Fitbit Pay in the same manner as any other transaction you complete using your Card.</p>

                    <p>You agree to use Fitbit Pay in accordance with these Fitbit Pay Terms and the Terms, and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. You will not use Fitbit Pay for any fraudulent or unlawful purposes, and your use of Fitbit Pay will comply with Section 7 of the Terms, including but not limited to refraining from (i) circumventing any technological measure implemented by Fitbit or any of Fitbit&#x2019;s providers or any other third party (including another user) to protect Fitbit Pay or (ii) accessing Fitbit Pay through the use of any mechanism other than as authorized under these Fitbit Pay Terms.

All information collected by Fitbit as part of Fitbit Pay is subject to the Fitbit Privacy Policy. Using Fitbit Pay will require you to have used the Fitbit mobile app to set a PIN code for use on your Supported Device. While Fitbit implements measures to help protect your information, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your PIN code and for maintaining possession of your Supported Device and mobile device. If you lose your Supported Device, you can suspend Fitbit Pay through the Fitbit mobile app or disable Fitbit Pay through the Fitbit website. Your Card number is not stored on the Supported Device or in the Fitbit mobile app, and through an industry standard tokenisation platform your Card information is never revealed or shared with merchants or Fitbit when completing a transaction.</p>

                    <h2>4. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>
                    <p>The Limitation of Liability set out in the Terms (Section 22) applies to your use of Fitbit Pay. In addition, neither Fitbit, its suppliers, or licensors, nor any other party involved in creating or delivering Fitbit Pay, will be liable for any damages or liabilities of any kind arising out of or in connection with any transaction, payment, or other use of Fitbit Pay, nor will Fitbit be responsible for any dispute relating to or arising out of your use of a Card. The Bank Terms applied by your Card&#x2019;s bank will apply to all such transactions, payments, uses, and disputes, and in no circumstances is Fitbit party to, or in any manner liable under, the Bank Terms.</p>

                    <p>Paid Services include content and personalised, interactive services. They may be one-time purchases or automatically renewing subscription services, like our Programmes and Live Coaching Services (&#x201C;Subscriptions&#x201D;). Please see the product page for your specific Paid Services for more information. We may make changes to, suspend or discontinue Paid Services at any time for any reason, and we have the sole discretion to determine which portions of the Fitbit Service require payment.</p>

                    <h2>2. Subscriptions</h2>
                    <p><strong>Automatically Renewing Subscriptions.</strong> Your Subscription term may vary, for example, with monthly or annual automatic renewal terms (a &#x201C;Subscription Term&#x201D;), as described in the course of your transaction. <strong>Your Subscription will automatically renew for additional Subscription Terms as long as your Subscription continues, until you cancel it or we suspend or stop providing the Subscription in accordance with our <a href="/sg/legal/terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a>.</strong> Unless otherwise indicated by us, you will be charged prior to, or at the beginning of, each renewal term. Before charging you for a Subscription Term, we will notify you of the applicable fees, and the renewal will occur at the price then in effect for the Paid Service.</p>
                    <p><strong>Subscription Cancellation. You may cancel your Subscription at any time. Your cancellation will take effect at the end of the current Subscription Term.</strong></p>
                    <p>In the event you cancel your Subscription, note that we may still send you promotional communications about Fitbit, unless you opt out of receiving those communications by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the communications.</p>
                    <p><strong>No Refunds on Subscriptions.</strong> When you cancel a Subscription, you cancel only future charges for your Subscription. You will not receive a refund for the current Subscription Term you paid for, but you will continue to have full access to that Subscription until the end of that current Subscription Term. At any time for any reason, we may provide a refund, discount, or other consideration (&#x201C;credits&#x201D;) to some or all of our users. The amount and form of such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole and absolute discretion. The provision of credits in one instance does not entitle you to credits in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide credits in the future.</p>
                    <p><strong>Free Trials.</strong> From time to time, we may offer free trials of certain Subscriptions for specified periods of time without payment. If we offer you a free trial, the specific terms of your free trial will be provided in the marketing materials describing the particular trial. <strong>Once your free trial ends, we (or our third-party payment processor) will begin billing your designated payment method on a recurring basis for your Subscription (plus any applicable taxes and other charges) for as long as your Subscription continues, unless you cancel your Subscription prior to the end of your free trial. Instructions for cancelling your Subscription are described in the sections above. To avoid any charges, you must cancel your Subscription before the end of your free trial period. Before charging you at the end of the your free trial period, we will notify you of the applicable fees.</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Price Changes.</strong>  We reserve the right to adjust pricing for our Paid Services or any components thereof in any manner and at any time. Any price changes will take effect following notice to you.</p>

                    <h2>3. One-Time Purchases</h2>
                    <p>Certain Paid Services are one-time purchases, and not subscription-based. One-time purchases may not be cancelled and you are not entitled to a refund for such services.</p>

                    <h2>4. Payment and Billing</h2>
                    <p>You authorise Fitbit to charge your chosen payment method for the Paid Services. By providing a payment method that we accept, you represent and warrant that you are authorised to use the designated payment method and that you authorise us (or our third-party payment processor) to charge your payment method for the total amount of your purchase (including any applicable taxes and other charges). If the payment method cannot be verified, is invalid or is otherwise not acceptable, your Paid Service may be suspended or cancelled. You must resolve any problem we encounter in relation to the payment method you select in order to proceed with your use of the Service.</p>
                    <p>Please note that if you accept a promotional offer or make changes to your Paid Services, the amount billed may vary. It may also fluctuate due to changes in applicable taxes or currency exchange rates. You authorise us (or our third-party payment processor) to charge your payment method for the corresponding amount.</p>

                    <h2>5. Representations, Warranties and Covenants</h2>
                    <p>Any Paid Services are personal to you and may not be used by any other person. You will not allow anyone else to use your Paid Services, and you will not transfer any Subscription or disclose your password to any other person. You will report to Fitbit any unauthorised or prohibited use of your Paid Services.</p>
